## Introduction
<p>The manner in which electronic medical record software is developed has a significant flaw. It is undeniable that they do in fact help reduce errors and improve the continuity in patient data, however, there is minimal compatibility and lateral transferability between healthcare professionals. For example, if a family physician is requesting a patient's test results from another medical institution such as a hospital, a request needs to still be made for the information to be transferred. Even after being transferred, it is unlikely that both parties are using the same electronic medical record system, so information needs to be re-transcribed into the patient's file. As the adoption of electronic medical records is presently occurring at a rapid rate, it would be beneficial to solve the problem of continuity of medical information between medical parties now. It would be double the work to have the majority of medical practitioners adopt and get comfortable with different systems, and then have to implement another framework to enable continuity between which may ensue changes to existing systems. In our project, we decided to build a web app that can be used every hospital, to store records of patients and information about every doctor in a hospital. This app will eradicate the need for hospitals to manually communicate with each other, and manually query and send for patients records.
